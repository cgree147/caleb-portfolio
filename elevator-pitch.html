        Hi, my name is Caleb Green. I’m about to graduate from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a degree in Management Information Systems and a minor in Software Systems. I'm looking to start a career in data analytics or business intelligence because I enjoy uncovering patterns in data and turning it into something useful for real world processes.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Recently, I developed a predictive model for a health and athletic club that automated their pool chemical ordering process. Through this project, I was able to develop skills such as data cleaning, forecasting with Scikit-learn, and visualization with Tableau.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        I'm most confident about my skills in Python, SQL, and designing solutions that bridge the gap between data and decision making.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        I'm inspired by the field of data analytics because it’s always evolving and has the power to impact every industry from finance to healthcare to sports. You can truly do anything with enough data.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        My ultimate aim is to become a leading creator in data driven strategy design, helping organizations make smarter decisions through analytics and automation.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        I'm currently looking for a fall internship in data analytics, business intelligence, or IT consulting where I can contribute from day one to creating models that have a real impact.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Do you have any suggestions or advice on what skills and platforms are industry standard that I would benefit from being proficient in? Are you familiar with any companies that value strong technical and communication skills?
      </p>
