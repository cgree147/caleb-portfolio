      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Creating this digital portfolio has been a rewarding process both technically and personally. It has allowed me to demonstrate not only what I’ve learned in the classroom, but how I can apply those skills creatively and professionally. It also taught me a lot about how others perceive professional branding and how intentional design, language, and packaging can shape opportunities. I've really enjoyed practicing my technical skills with coding in HTML5 all while becoming more cognizant of how I portray myself to potential employers online.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"> How effective was my digital portfolio in presenting my personal brand?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">I believe this portfolio effectively communicates my personal brand as a thoughtful, skilled, and detail-oriented data science and information systems student. Each page is clean, organized, and designed with intention. The technical implementation of the site, coded entirely from scratch, reinforces my proficiency in tools like HTML, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub. More importantly, it tells a story of who I am and how I think.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"> What improvements can I make to enhance my digital reputation?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Moving forward, I plan to enhance this site by integrating JavaScript-driven functionality and converting it to a single-page React app with reusable components. I also want to maintain consistent updates to my blog, showcase more technical projects, and possibly add a downloadable project showcase or filterable gallery. Keeping the content fresh and the tech stack current will help me stay relevant to employers and peers.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"> What I Learned from Others</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Reviewing the portfolios of others during this assignment gave me valuable perspective on how diverse professional branding can be. It showed me how subtle choices in tone, visuals, and structure can influence a viewer’s perception. It also opened my eyes to the fact that people can only perceive what you put out for them to see, any accomplishments or skills you don't put out there, people aren't going to know about. I learned that building a portfolio isn't just about highlighting accomplishments, it's also about creating an experience that communicates reliability, capability, and growth potential.</p>

    <section class="mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"> Ethics, Credibility & Boundaries</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">As I built my online presence, I became more aware of the importance of boundaries and authenticity. I made sure to include only relevant professional content while keeping personal details limited. Ethics and credibility played a big role in how I chose to frame my skills, I want potential employers to trust what they see and feel confident that I can deliver what I showcase. A large part of why I decided to set up my portfolio in this way was to help establish credibility and demonstrate what I can do in a more immediately tangible way for the viewer. I believe that being truthful and intentional with online content is important for everyone in their professional life, and it is something I will continue to be mindful of.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"> How can I continue developing and maintaining my online presence?</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700">My plan is to continue building my online presence by writing regularly on LinkedIn, contributing to GitHub projects, and optimizing my SEO presence for data analytics and information systems roles. I’ll continue to monitor analytics on my portfolio site (if deployed) and tailor content to reflect my professional growth. Ultimately, this portfolio isn’t just a class project, it's something I plan to use for long-term digital reputation building.</p>
